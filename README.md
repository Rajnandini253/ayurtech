# AyurTech 🌿 
**Ancient Wisdom Engine | MCA First Year Project**
AyurTech is an MCA project fusing ancient Ayurveda with modern AI. It features a weighted NLP engine for typo-tolerant symptom analysis and a Euclidean Distance algorithm to quantify wellness variance. Built with Next.js and Framer Motion, it prioritizes user privacy through 100% offline, local-first data processing and history tracking.
AyurTech is a high-performance wellness engine that maps Ayurvedic principles to modern data structures. It calculates the variance between a user's baseline (Prakruthi) and current state (Vikruti) using vector geometry.
